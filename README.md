# PrusaSlicer-MK3S-FilamentSettings
Some of my custom filament settings proven on my MK3S with enclosure.

Modified versions of the existing PrusaSlicer profiles have a "My" prefix to prevent collision with the existing ones.

## Fillamentum Flexfill 98A
Based on an official Recreus profile for Recreus Filaflex 82A.

Default FLEX PrusaSlicer profiles have a very slow volumetric speed limit, what makes FLEX prints very slow, a very conservative retraction length and a very high over-extrusion. This one prints as fast as a regular filament, with a properly set extrusion, and with very low stringing. I have been testing it for some time now and I can't say I had any issues.

## NOTE
I use an E3D V6 Silicone Sock on the heatblock, and a Prusa Lack enclosure, so the temperatures are set accordingly. For use without a sock you might need to increase the head temperature for ~2-3Â°C, but that's your choice to find the temperature that works the best for you.

Keep in mind that lower temperatures result in better defined prints, but in lower layer adhesion (FLEX will have a good layer adhesion even on lower temperatures).
