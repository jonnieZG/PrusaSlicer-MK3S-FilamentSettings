# PrusaSlicer-MK3S-FilamentSettings
Some of my custom filament settings proven on my MK3S with enclosure.

Modified versions of the existing PrusaSlicer profiles have a "My" prefix to prevent collision with the existing ones.

## Fillamentum Flexfill 98A
Based on an official Recreus profile for Recreus Filaflex 82A.

Default FLEX PrusaSlicer profiles have a very slow volumetric speed limit, what makes FLEX prints very slow, a very conservative retraction length and a very high over-extrusion. This one prints as fast as a regular filament, with a properly set extrusion, and with very low stringing. I have been testing it for some time now and I can't say I had any issues.
